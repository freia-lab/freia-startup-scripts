#- Only Relays 1 - -4 are supported (there is no support for relays A and B, see TPG300 documentation).
#- One can attach one or two relays to any controller's channel (relay can be attched only to one channel)
#- Some macro macro definitions are connected with each other and MUST be always the same like below:

#- RELAY1_SOURCE = A, RELAY1 = 1
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = B, RELAY1 = 2
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = C, RELAY1 = 3
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = D, RELAY1 = 4

#- RELAY1_SOURCE = A, RELAY2 = 1
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = B, RELAY2 = 2
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = C, RELAY2 = 3
#- RELAY1_SOURCE = D, RELAY2 = 4

# CHANNEL = A1, SOURCE = A
# CHANNEL = A2, SOURCE = B
# CHANNEL = B1, SOURCE = C
# CHANNEL = B2, SOURCE = D

#- BOARD - must be PE or PI and correspond to the board sitting in the controller
#- GAUGE - any string describing the gauge connected to a given channel
#- CONTROLLER - any string - is the prefix to the PVs related to the controller
#- DEVICENAME - is the prefix for the PVs of the gauge connected to a given channel
